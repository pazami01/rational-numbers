# Rational Numbers

This is my implementation of rational numbers.

The operations that were implemented:
- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two rational numbers,
- absolute value of a given rational number,
- exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, 
- exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, 
- exponentiation of a real number to a rational number, and
- display as `n/d`, where `n` is the numerator and `d` is the denominator.
